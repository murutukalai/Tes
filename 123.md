If you'd like to pass a trait with an async function as input for handling a shutdown signal in Axum, you can use `dyn` traits with `async` functions. However, Rust doesn't directly support `async` functions in traits, so you'll need to use `async_trait`, a common crate that enables this pattern.

Here's an example where we define a shutdown signal handler as a trait and pass it to the server:

### Example Code

```rust
use async_trait::async_trait;
use axum::{Router, routing::get};
use std::{net::SocketAddr, sync::Arc};
use tokio::sync::Notify;
use tower::ServiceBuilder;
use tower_http::trace::TraceLayer;

#[async_trait]
trait ShutdownSignal {
    async fn wait_for_shutdown(&self);
}

struct SignalHandler {
    notify: Arc<Notify>,
}

#[async_trait]
impl ShutdownSignal for SignalHandler {
    async fn wait_for_shutdown(&self) {
        self.notify.notified().await; // Wait for notification
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Create a shared Notify instance for signaling shutdown
    let notify = Arc::new(Notify::new());
    let signal_handler = SignalHandler {
        notify: notify.clone(),
    };

    // Spawn a task to listen for Ctrl+C and notify the shutdown
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        tokio::signal::ctrl_c()
            .await
            .expect("Failed to install CTRL+C handler");
        println!("Shutdown signal received.");
        notify.notify_one();
    });

    // Build the Axum app
    let app = Router::new().route("/", get(|| async { "Hello, World!" }))
        .layer(ServiceBuilder::new().layer(TraceLayer::new_for_http()));

    // Define the server address
    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000));
    println!("Server running at http://{}", addr);

    // Start the server with the custom shutdown handler
    axum::Server::bind(&addr)
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .with_graceful_shutdown(signal_handler.wait_for_shutdown())
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
```

### Key Points in This Example:
1. **`ShutdownSignal` Trait**:
   - A trait named `ShutdownSignal` is created with an `async` function `wait_for_shutdown` using the `async_trait` crate.

2. **SignalHandler Struct**:
   - The `SignalHandler` struct implements the `ShutdownSignal` trait. It uses a `tokio::sync::Notify` to notify the shutdown.

3. **Passing the Trait**:
   - The `SignalHandler` instance is created and passed to `with_graceful_shutdown` as `signal_handler.wait_for_shutdown()`.

4. **`async_trait`**:
   - The `async_trait` crate is used to enable `async` methods in traits since Rust does not natively support `async` in trait methods.

### Dependencies
Add these dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
axum = "0.6"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
tower = "0.4"
tower-http = "0.3"
async-trait = "0.1"
```

### How It Works
- The `with_graceful_shutdown` takes the `wait_for_shutdown` function, which is an async function implemented via the `ShutdownSignal` trait.
- When a shutdown signal (e.g., `Ctrl+C`) is received, the `Notify` instance is triggered, and the server shuts down gracefully. 

This design pattern provides flexibility to use any type that implements the `ShutdownSignal` trait, enabling customizable shutdown logic.
