### üß† **Rust & Compiler Concepts**

**Q1. Can you explain how ownership and the borrow checker help in building safe abstractions in your Rust projects?**

**A:**  
Ownership and the borrow checker are at the core of Rust‚Äôs memory safety model. They help prevent data races and dangling pointers at compile time. In my projects, I use ownership rules to ensure clear data flow and avoid unnecessary cloning. For instance, when building APIs with shared resources, I use references with proper lifetimes to pass data safely between layers. The borrow checker enforces disciplined use, which leads to cleaner and more predictable code.

**Q2. Have you ever worked on or with an AST or parser? What tools or libraries did you use?**

**A:**  
While I haven't worked on a full compiler yet, I‚Äôve experimented with building a simple parser for a DSL (domain-specific language) using `pest` and `syn`. I gained a basic understanding of tokenizing input, building ASTs, and traversing them for interpretation. I also reviewed how `syn` and `quote` are used in procedural macros, which gave me insight into Rust's macro system and compile-time code generation.

---

**Q3. Tell us about a time you used macros or lifetimes to solve a problem in a Rust project.**

**A:**  
In one project, I needed to generate repetitive code for struct serialization and logging. I used a custom `macro_rules!` macro to eliminate boilerplate and enforce consistency. Regarding lifetimes, I once worked with asynchronous database queries and had to use explicit lifetimes to keep references alive across `async` blocks without violating borrowing rules.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Systems & Blockchain**

**Q4. Do you have any experience with WebAssembly (WASM), Substrate, or other blockchain VMs?**

**A:**  
While I haven‚Äôt worked on a blockchain project professionally yet, I‚Äôve been exploring blockchain technologies out of personal interest. I‚Äôve read about Substrate and how WASM is used to power the runtime environment. I‚Äôve also experimented with compiling simple Rust code to WASM to understand the toolchain. I'm currently focused on learning how protocols like MOI or Substrate work under the hood and I‚Äôm confident in picking up blockchain-specific patterns quickly, thanks to my systems background in Rust.

---

**Q5. How do you approach writing efficient and maintainable low-level code?**

**A:**  
I start with readability and correctness, using idiomatic Rust patterns. Once functionality is verified, I use benchmarks (`criterion`) and profiling tools (`perf`, `flamegraph`) to detect bottlenecks. I apply `#[inline]`, avoid heap allocations where possible, and use iterators over loops for cleaner logic. Most importantly, I write tests early and document modules to ensure maintainability over time.

### ü§ù **Collaboration & Tools**

**Q6. Describe how you manage dependencies and build automation in Rust using tools like Cargo or rustc.**

**A:**  
I use `cargo` for all builds, testing, and dependency management. I organize workspace-level dependencies in `Cargo.toml`, prefer using minimal versions, and audit crates with `cargo-audit`. For larger projects, I automate builds using `Makefiles` or CI pipelines that run `cargo check`, `clippy`, and `fmt` to maintain code quality.

---

**Q7. How comfortable are you switching between Rust and Golang in a mixed-language codebase?**

**A:**  
I‚Äôm comfortable switching contexts. While Rust is my primary language, I‚Äôve read and modified Golang code to understand backend service integrations. I focus on interfaces and data flow between modules, and I make sure to follow idioms of each language instead of mixing paradigms. I'm quick to pick up patterns and maintain readability across both ecosystems.

### üîß **Advanced Technical Questions**

**Q8. How would you design a virtual machine (VM) in Rust? What modules would you consider?**  
**Hint:** Talk about components like bytecode interpreter, memory model, gas metering, stack-based execution, module loading, etc. Emphasize modularity, safety, and how Rust's enums and traits help in opcode dispatching.

---

**Q9. How do you ensure deterministic behavior in blockchain environments using Rust?**  
**Hint:** Mention avoiding randomness, using fixed-seed PRNGs, avoiding floating-point math, deterministic ordering with `BTreeMap`, etc.

---

**Q10. Can you explain how Serde works under the hood and how it‚Äôs useful for blockchain systems?**  
**Hint:** Explain the derive macros (`#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]`), Serde traits (`Serialize`, `Deserialize`), and its zero-copy capability. Mention how compact and consistent serialization helps in blockchain state syncing or storage.

---

**Q11. How would you build a secure sandboxed execution environment in Rust?**  
**Hint:** Mention WASM runtime, limited syscalls, resource quotas, capabilities model, and memory-safe execution enforced by Rust.

---

**Q12. Describe how you'd implement a plugin system in Rust using traits and dynamic dispatch.**  
**Hint:** Explain trait objects (`Box<dyn Plugin>`), dynamic loading (`libloading` crate if needed), and clean separation of concerns via interface-based architecture.

---

### üß© **Cross-Functional / Codebase Integration**

**Q13. How would you debug a memory-related bug in Rust that doesn‚Äôt cause a panic but results in unexpected behavior?**  
**Hint:** Use `miri`, `valgrind` (if using unsafe), logging, binary search on recent changes, and unit tests with controlled inputs.

---

**Q14. How do you trace or monitor performance in Rust systems?**  
**Hint:** Mention `tracing`, `tokio-console`, `flamegraph`, `perf`, `metrics` crate. Show your familiarity with real observability practices.

---

### üß† **Behavioral Questions**

**Q15. Describe a time when you had to learn a complex technology quickly. How did you approach it?**  
**Hint:** Pick a real example ‚Äî maybe learning Golang, Substrate, or WASM. Show curiosity, structured learning (docs, tutorials, small project), and applied output.

---

**Q16. How do you deal with disagreements in a technical team?**  
**Hint:** Talk about discussing with humility, using evidence (benchmarks, examples), being open to other ideas, and choosing the best solution for the project.
No worries at all ‚Äî you're not alone! Many developers break into blockchain roles without prior protocol-level experience. The key is to **focus on your strong Rust skills, learning mindset, and transferable systems knowledge**.

---

**Q17. What motivates you to work in blockchain and protocol development?**  
**A:**  
I'm excited by the idea of decentralized infrastructure and how it's changing the way systems interact. Even though I‚Äôm new to blockchain development, I see it as the next step for a systems-focused developer like me. I‚Äôm drawn to the challenge of building secure, performant, and verifiable protocols ‚Äî and I see Rust as the perfect language for this kind of work. Joining a team like Sarva Labs would give me the environment to grow in this direction under the guidance of experienced mentors.
