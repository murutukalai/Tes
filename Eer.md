Yes, **OpenObserve** (formerly known as **ZincObserve**) supports sending **alerts and notifications**, including **email notifications**, based on log data and error patterns. Here’s how you can send error notifications to email in OpenObserve:

### **Step-by-step to send error notifications to email in OpenObserve**

#### 1. **Set up Alerts**
- Go to **Alerts** tab in the OpenObserve UI.
- Create a new alert by defining:
  - A **query** that detects the error (e.g., `level:error` or any specific pattern).
  - The **alert condition** (e.g., when count exceeds a threshold in a time window).
  - **Schedule**: how often to run the query.

#### 2. **Configure Email Notification**
- In the alert configuration, add a **notification channel**.
- Choose **Email**.
- Provide:
  - **SMTP server** (e.g., smtp.gmail.com)
  - Port, Username, Password (or app-specific password for services like Gmail)
  - **To address** (email where you want to receive the alerts)
  - **From address**

#### 3. **Test It**
- Click on "Send test notification" (if available) to verify the setup.
- Save the alert.

### **Optional: Using environment variables or secrets**
If you’re deploying OpenObserve in containers (like Docker or Kubernetes), you can configure SMTP settings via environment variables.

Example:
```bash
ZO_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
ZO_SMTP_PORT=587
ZO_SMTP_USERNAME=you@example.com
ZO_SMTP_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

Do you want to integrate this with your Axum/Leptos app too? I can help trigger logs or alerts from your Rust backend if needed.
