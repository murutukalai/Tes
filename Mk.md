The approach depends on what you’re trying to achieve. The original example shows how to customize headers for a WebSocket handshake using an asynchronous API (tokio-tungstenite). In Rust, the [ureq](https://crates.io/crates/ureq) crate is a synchronous (blocking) HTTP client and does not support WebSocket upgrade handshakes. That said, you have two paths:

---

## 1. Synchronous WebSocket Connection with Custom Headers

If your goal is to open a WebSocket connection with custom headers but in a blocking (synchronous) manner, you can use the synchronous API of the [tungstenite](https://crates.io/crates/tungstenite) crate. Its API is very similar to the asynchronous one but runs in a blocking style. For example:

```rust
use tungstenite::{connect, client::IntoClientRequest};
use url::Url;
use http::{HeaderValue};

fn main() {
    let ws_url = Url::parse("wss://example.com/socket").unwrap();

    // Create a custom WebSocket request
    let mut request = ws_url.into_client_request().unwrap();

    // Add custom headers
    let headers = request.headers_mut();
    headers.insert("Authorization", HeaderValue::from_static("Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"));
    headers.insert("Custom-Header", HeaderValue::from_static("SomeValue"));

    // Establish the WebSocket connection with the modified request
    let (mut socket, response) = connect(request).expect("Can't connect");
    println!("Connected with response: {:?}", response);

    // Now you can use `socket` to send and receive messages.
}
```

This example uses `tungstenite::connect` (a blocking function) and is equivalent in spirit to the asynchronous example, but without using Tokio. Notice that we still construct the HTTP request with custom headers before initiating the WebSocket handshake.

## 2. Making an HTTP Request with Custom Headers Using ureq

If instead you meant that you want to perform a standard HTTP request (not a WebSocket connection) with custom headers using [ureq](https://crates.io/crates/ureq), you can do that as follows:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Make a GET request to an HTTP endpoint with custom headers
    let response = ureq::get("https://example.com/api")
        .set("Authorization", "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN")
        .set("Custom-Header", "SomeValue")
        .call();

    if response.ok() {
        let body = response.into_string().unwrap();
        println!("Response: {}", body);
    } else {
        println!("Request failed: {}", response.status());
    }
}
```

This code uses ureq’s fluent API to set headers and perform a blocking HTTP GET request.

---

## Which One to Use?

- **For WebSocket connections:**  
  Use the synchronous tungstenite API (first example).  
- **For regular HTTP requests:**  
  Use ureq (second example).

Since ureq doesn’t support WebSocket upgrade handshakes, it isn’t a drop‑in replacement for tokio‑tungstenite if your goal is to open a WebSocket connection with custom headers.
