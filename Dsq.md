Got it! You want to list all dates **between a range** along with **time log data** from a table (e.g., `time_log`) that stores:

- `user_id`
- `in_time` as `BIGINT` (likely a Unix timestamp)

Assuming:
- You want to **match `in_time` to the generated dates**
- You want to **join the generated date series with the `time_log` table**

Here’s how you can do it in **PostgreSQL**, converting the `BIGINT` timestamp to `DATE` for joining:

```sql
SELECT 
  gs.date,
  tl.user_id,
  to_timestamp(tl.in_time) AS in_time_timestamp
FROM generate_series('2025-04-01'::date, '2025-04-10'::date, interval '1 day') AS gs(date)
LEFT JOIN time_log tl
  ON DATE(to_timestamp(tl.in_time)) = gs.date
ORDER BY gs.date, tl.user_id;
```

### Explanation:
- `generate_series(...)` creates a row for each day.
- `to_timestamp(tl.in_time)` converts the BIGINT Unix timestamp into a proper `timestamp`.
- `DATE(to_timestamp(...))` extracts the date part to match with the generated series.
- `LEFT JOIN` ensures all dates are listed even if there’s no time log entry for that day.

Would you like to filter by a specific user or include additional info from the `time_log` table?
