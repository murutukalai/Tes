If you want to automatically detect (or "dedicate") a country in Rust, you typically need to use an IP-based geolocation service or some other country-detection logic based on user input (such as locale settings). Below is a Rust example using the `geolocation` crate to determine a country from an IP address.  

### Example: Detect Country from IP  
You'll need to use a geolocation API like `ip-api.com` or `ipinfo.io`. Hereâ€™s how you can do it in Rust using `reqwest` and `serde`:  

#### 1. Add dependencies to `Cargo.toml`:  
```toml
[dependencies]
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json"] }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
```

#### 2. Write the Rust Code:  
```rust
use reqwest;
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
struct IpInfo {
    country: String,
    countryCode: String,
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let url = "http://ip-api.com/json/";
    let response: IpInfo = reqwest::get(url).await?.json().await?;

    println!("Detected Country: {} ({})", response.country, response.countryCode);
    Ok(())
}
```

### How It Works:
- The program sends an HTTP request to `ip-api.com/json/` to get IP geolocation data.
- It parses the JSON response and extracts the country name and code.
- It prints the detected country.

Would you like modifications, such as using a different API or handling errors better?
